**alleviated matrix package**

## get start :
  **how to compile** ? 
  use 'make' to compile all the package you need.

  **how to evaluate** ?
  command './test_matix_fun'

## brief intro :
  This is a small package for some matrix operation. It supports N*N size for the matrix and the operations/functions including transpose, dot product, matrix product, elementwise arithmatics, multiplication, divide, cofator matrix, determinant operation, and inverse matrix operation. Check details in .cpp file.
  
## after work :
  I am just too lazy to devote to my career. Hence I wrote the code to kill time though I've been really bust lately. Now, next work will be the eigenvalue/vector processing if I get some more free time in the future. I wrote this for fun and practice some basic syntax in C++. Hope you guys love it.
